        "is an open-source library that helps developers search for similar embeddings in multimedia documents:\n",
        "## What it does\n",
        "**FAISS** is a library that helps developers quickly search for **similar embeddings in multimedia documents.** It's designed to handle **large-scale datasets** and is a *key tool for applications in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science.*\n",
        "\n",
        "## How it works\n",
        "**FAISS** assumes that *instances are represented as vectors* and can be compared using **L2 (Euclidean) distances or dot products.** It uses a variety of algorithms and optimizations to ensure it remains at the forefront of vector database technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why it's useful\n",
        "**FAISS** solves limitations of traditional query search engines, which are optimized for hash-based searches. It's a valuable tool for applications that require rapid and accurate similarity searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Some of its features\n",
        "FAISS includes a variety of index structures, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **IndexIVFFlat:** Uses an inverted file system to divide the dataset into clusters and assign a list of vectors to each cluster. This index structure is suitable for large-scale applications.\n",
        "* **IndexIVFPQ:** Combines Product Quantization (PQ) and an inverted file system to store and retrieve high-dimensional embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Where to learn more\n",
        "* You can learn more about FAISS from the [Faiss documentation](https://faiss.ai/?form=MG0AV3), [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss?form=MG0AV3), and other resources.\n",
